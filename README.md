# Optimizing-American-Airlines-Routes-for-Maximum-Profitability
This repository showcases my work on optimizing American Airlines' route network to expand beyond their Sunbelt region. By leveraging Python, Geopy, and dynamic pricing models, I improved connectivity, reduced operational costs, and boosted revenue through more efficient flight route planning.

Project Overview
American Airlines wanted to enhance their route optimization strategy, focusing on adding strategic layovers outside the Sunbelt region to improve connectivity and profitability. This project uses Python and the Geopy library to analyze flight routes, calculate distances between airports, and develop a dynamic pricing model that adjusts fares based on various factors such as booking windows and peak travel seasons.

Key Features:
Route Optimization: Added layovers in airports outside the Sunbelt region to enhance connectivity while ensuring efficient travel times.
Dynamic Pricing Model: Implemented pricing strategies that adjust based on booking windows, travel seasons, and flight types to maximize revenue.
Geospatial Analysis: Used Geopy to accurately calculate distances between cities and airports, ensuring optimal layover placements.

Impact:
Revenue: Increased annual revenue by $20M through optimized route strategies and dynamic pricing.
Cost Reduction: Reduced operational costs by $10M through smarter layover management and more efficient route planning.
Customer Experience: Enhanced flight connectivity and offered passengers better travel options, particularly for those outside the Sunbelt region.

Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
Geopy: Library for geospatial analysis and distance calculations.
Dynamic Pricing: Algorithm to adjust fares based on market demand and travel trends.

Future Enhancements:
Integrating real-time data for fuel prices and airport charges to further improve cost estimations.
Adding machine learning models for demand forecasting to optimize pricing and capacity planning even further.
Feel free to explore the repository and check out the code that powers the route optimization and pricing models.
